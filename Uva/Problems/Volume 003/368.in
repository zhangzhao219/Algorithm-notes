<BODY>
<P>Write a program to create an index of a small collection
of World Wide Web pages.
Each "page" is a text file in a
special format called HTML (HyperText Markup Language).
The
HTML format includes regular text and special HTML commands,
which are always enclosed in angle braces.
For example, the
string <A HREF="layout.htm"> is an HTML command meaning that
the following text should be highlighted; a user click on
the highlighted text would cause a web browser to fetch and
display the file layout.htm.</P>
<H1>Following Links</H1>
<P>Don't forget that links can be <A HREF="index.htm">
self-referential</A>!</P>

<A bunch of gibberish and a word>
Note that there is no rule that the file needs to be legal HTML
(if you know the rules), or that words really be wordseiwlaoieu;a.
<A HREF="index.htm">Watch out for mutual references!
